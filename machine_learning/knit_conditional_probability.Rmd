## data summary

We have a hypothetical population of 1 million individuals with the following conditional probabilities as described below:

The test is positive 85% of the time when tested on a patient with the disease (high sensitivity):  𝑃(test+|disease)=0.85 
The test is negative 90% of the time when tested on a healthy patient (high specificity):  𝑃(test−|heathy)=0.90 
The disease is prevalent in about 2% of the community:  𝑃(disease)=0.02



```{r sample dataset for conditional probability}
set.seed(1, sample.kind="Rounding") 

disease <- sample(c(0,1), size=1e6, replace=TRUE, prob=c(0.98,0.02))
test <- rep(NA, 1e6)
test[disease==0] <- sample(c(0,1), size=sum(disease==0), replace=TRUE, prob=c(0.90,0.10))
test[disease==1] <- sample(c(0,1), size=sum(disease==1), replace=TRUE, prob=c(0.15, 0.85))

head(test)

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
